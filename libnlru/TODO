- There is no mutex in nlru so the only mutual exclusion we can use is from libfh. This means that all operations on ll
should be done while the fh entry is locked i.e. 
  . nlru_search() should fh_searchlock() and move
  . nlru_add() should fh_insertlock() and get spare ll (free it if necessary), add it and move it to top
